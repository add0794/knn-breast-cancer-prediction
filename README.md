# Predicting Breast Cancer Outcomes using KNN: A Novel Approach

## About the Paper

This project utilizes the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign based on quantitative features such as compactness, concavity, and smoothness. By employing a non-traditional approach to hyperparameter tuning, where the optimal value of *k* is derived by finding the smallest difference in accuracy between the training and test sets, this study aims to optimize the performance of the KNN model. The use of KNN for breast cancer classification leverages its ability to handle complex datasets and provide accurate predictions, making it a promising approach for this challenging problem.

## Usability

In addition to a Jupyter notebook covering my work, an object-oriented implementation of the KNN algorithm in this project is included. This provides a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners working with a new dataset. By encapsulating the functionality into classes and methods, the code enables efficient testing and integration of the model into existing projects. This is important because replication into your own datasets will advance and extend KNN's use.
